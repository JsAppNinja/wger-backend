Thank you for downloading wger Workout Manager. wger is a free, open source web
application that manages your exercises and personal workouts, weight and diet
plans. It can also be used as a simple gym management utility, providing different
administrative roles (trainer, manager, etc.). It offers a REST API as well, for
easy integration with other projects and tools.

It is written with python/django and uses jQuery and some D3js for charts.

For more details and a live system, refer to the project's site: https://wger.de/

There are more detailed instructions, other deployment options as well as an
administration guide available at https://wger.readthedocs.org or locally in
your code repository in the docs folder (``make html`` to compile, then open
_build/index.html).


Installation
============

These are the basic steps to install and run the application locally on a linux
system.

::

 $ sudo apt-get install python-dev python-virtualenv
 $ virtualenv venv-django
 $ source venv-django/bin/activate

::

 $ git clone https://github.com/rolandgeider/wger.git
 $ cd wger
 $ pip install -r requirements.txt  # or requirements_devel.txt to develop
