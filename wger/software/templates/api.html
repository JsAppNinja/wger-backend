<p>{% blocktrans %}wger Workout Manager provides a full REST API to all database
objects:{% endblocktrans %} <a href="/api/v1/?format=json">/api/v1/</a></p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}Public endpoints, such as the list of exercises or the
ingredients can be accessed without authentication. For user owned
objects such as workouts, you need to generate an API KEY and pass it
along with the username either in the header or in form of GET parameters.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}The API uses HATEOAS, so you should be able to browse
through the necessary endpoints without having to consult an extensive
documentation. At the moment, the API only supports read operations, but
support for full POST/PUT/DELETE/PATCH is planned for the near future.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<div class="alert alert-info" style="margin-top:1em;">
{% blocktrans %}This is also new for us, if you plan on using the API,
<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/wger">we'd love to hear from you</a>.{% endblocktrans %}
