<p>{% blocktrans %}wger Workout Manager is a free, open source web application that manages
your exercises and workouts. It started as a pet project of mine to replace my
growing collection of different spreadsheets, but it has become something other
people could also find useful.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h2>{% trans "The workout manager" %}</h2>

<p>{% blocktrans %}You probably guessed, this is the main function.
It creates the workout you tell it, the way you tell it. It is pretty flexible
so if you do supersets, no need to worry, it is supported and you will
know which exercises <em>belong together</em>. Each set can have a different
number of repetitions you want to reach and which you enter yourself.
This means that other training forms like pyramid training or similar are
not a problem.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<img src="{% static 'images/workout-manager-1.0.3-en.png' %}"
     class="bordered flexible"
     alt="">

<p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Note:</strong> it has no 'preset' workouts that you
can simply use (e.g. beginner, etc.). It will happily make the routine you tell
it to do, but you have to decide which exercises and how many repetitions you'll
do.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<h3>{% trans "PDF export" %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}It can also generate a PDF with your current routine.
This is suitable for printing so you can bring it to the gym and keep a log
for 7 weeks. In case you wonder how it looks like,
<a href="/static/pdf/workout-pdf-1.0.3-en.pdf">here's a sample</a>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>


<h3>{% trans "Exercise log" %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}The electronic version of the above PDF output, you can enter
the weights and repetitions you did for each exercise. As with the (body) weight,
it will generate some diagrams so so you can see at a glance how well you are doing.
The raw numbers are still accessible as a table.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<img src="{% static 'images/workout-log-1.1-en.png' %}" class="bordered flexible">


<h2>{% trans "Muscle and exercise database" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}The exercise database contains around hundred exercises
from which you can choose when creating a workout. Some have important notes
about the form to perform them. This is displayed in the workout overview
page, so you keep them in mind.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}If you entered weight logs for the currently shown exercise, it
will display your progress.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<img src="{% static 'images/muscle-overview-1.1-en.png' %}" class="bordered flexible" alt="">



<h2>{% trans "The weight tracker" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}This is a rather simple part that lets you log your body weight.
From this data it generates a rather nice looking chart, so you can see if you are
reaching your goals (be it gaining mass or losing it).{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}In case you want to jump ship after inputing your data from the
last years, simply export the data as CSV.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<img src="{% static 'images/weight-chart-1.0.3-en.png' %}" class="bordered flexible" alt="">

<h3>{% trans "Import" %}</h3>

<p>{% blocktrans %}If you already kept your weight in a spreadsheet, you can just
import it by copy-and-paste'ing it into the import assistant.{% endblocktrans %}</p>


<h2>{% trans "The nutrition schedule manager" %}</h2>
<p>{% blocktrans %}And finally it is a nutrition schedule manager. Here you can
create a diet plan and see some nutritional values (total energy, protein,
carbohydrates, and so on) about it. For the ingredients, it uses the very complete
list provided by the US Department of Agriculture, with around 8000
entries.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<img src="{% static 'images/nutrition-manager-1.0.3-en.png' %}" class="bordered flexible" alt="">

<p>{% blocktrans %}<strong>Note:</strong> this is not a log keeper. It does not
keep track of what you actually ate during the day and how it compares to
what the plan says. It simply shows you the nutritional values of the plan
you create.{% endblocktrans %}</p>

<p>{% blocktrans %}It can also be downloaded as a PDF you can keep on your
fridge, so you don't forget to follow the plan... And as with the workout
log, <a href="/static/pdf/nutrition-plan-pdf-1.0-en.pdf">here's a sample</a>.{% endblocktrans %}</p>
