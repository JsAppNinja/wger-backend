Workout Manager
===============

Workout Manager is a simple web application that manages your exercises and workouts. 

It can generate a PDF with your current routine, suitable for printing so you can keep a log about
your progress.

It also has a simple module that lets you keep an eye on your weight. It ouputs a plot, so you can
assess at a glance whether you will be reaching your goals.


Compatibility
=============

The icons used on the site are SVG images and that means that Internet Explorer will only render
them starting with version 9. As expected, all other modern browsers have no problems with this.

While the site uses heavily javascript, it is possible to access almost all the functionality
without it. The biggest exception to this is the weight chart, a SVG image that is generated on
the browser.

Licence

The application was written using django and is licenced under the Affero GPL 3 or later.
